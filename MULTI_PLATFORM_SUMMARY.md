## 🎨 Platform Content Examples

### LinkedIn
```
🚀 Just finished experimenting with Next.js server actions — 
and wow, it changes how backend logic feels inside React!

No more juggling separate API routes. You can call server code 
like a function inside your component 😎

Curious — do you think this approach will replace Express APIs 
for small apps?

LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter automatically. 

The best part? It's all AI-powered and runs in the background!
